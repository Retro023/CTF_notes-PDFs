During CTFs I take notes on cherry-tree then When I have completed the CTF I export mhy notes to a pdf
My notes are not amazing, I often tunnel vison onto the fun hacking stuff and forget to add notes (if some of the notes seem rushed I probably retroactivaly added them to explain what I did)


If your playing these CTF DO NOT READ THESE NOTES AS THEY ARE SPOLIERS THESE ARE NOT WRITE UPS BUT JUST MY NOTES
